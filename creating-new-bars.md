# Creating New Bars

Superusers are the only user type with the correct privileges to add a new bar on the platform.

## What is a Bar?
Bars are LineHop entities that are displayed to local LineHop users. A LineHop entity includes the following bits of information:

- Name
- City
- Location Coordinates
- Profile Picture
- Skip-the-line Pass details (availability and price)

## Who manages Bar entities?
Bars can independently exist from a bar administrator, but some features will be unavailable. Superusers can create and manage bar entities or create a new bar administrator account. Here are some limitations with superuser managed bars:

- Superuser managed bars can not send out bar specific notifications.
- Superuser managed bars should not enable Skip-the-Line passes (as local bars may not want this)

To create a new bar administrator account (for local bars), follow the "[Creating New Users](https://github.com/linehop/guides/blob/master/Guides/creating-new-users.md)" guide. Bar administrators have the ability to:

- Update profile information about their bar.
- Send out bar-specific notifications.
- Enable Skip-the-Line passes.
- Monitor sales for Skip-the-Line passes.

## How do I create a new Bar?
