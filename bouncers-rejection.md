# Rejecting Entry

This guide is for bars who sell skip-the-line passes through LineHop. Please have your employees/bouncers read over this guide to ensure optimal results.

If someone requests to come inside on a skip-the-line pass that:

- Does not have a moving profile picture.
- Not for your bar or doesn't say "ANYBAR".

You will need to reject their entry. This pass may be fake or a screenshot.
