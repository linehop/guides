# Creating New Users
LineHop has three types of users available on the platform. These three types include:

- Superuser
- Bar administrator user
- Facebook/iOS app user

Depending on which kind of user you are, your account will have a different level of clearance with its own set of privileges. Facebook/iOS app users do not have the level of clearance needed to access the web-administrative panel. This portal is reserved for superusers and bar administrators.

## What is a superuser?
Superusers hold the highest level of clearance that enables them to:

- Create new bars and bar administrators.
- Monitor bars and bar administrators.
- Update details about bars and bar administrators.
- Disable/Enable bars on the platform.
- Monitor Skip-the-Line pass sales for every bar.

A superuser profile includes a username and password.

## What is a bar administrator?
Bar administrators hold the middle clearance level that enables them to:

- Monitor their own bar.
- Monitor Skip-the-Line pass sales for their bar.

A bar administrator profile includes a username, email address, password and the bar that they're managing. Superusers can create new bar administrator accounts. Please follow the guide below.

## How do I add a new bar administrator?
**A.** Add a new bar administrator by signing into https://linehop.us and navigating to the "Users" page (in the navigation bar).

**C.** Fill out the form.

**D.** Specify which bar you want this bar administrator to manage. 

If you have not created their bar yet, leave the drop down on the "Choose a tavern..." option. You can assign the bar to their user in the "Edit" panel after both have been setup.

**E.** Click "Save".
