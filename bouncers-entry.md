# Bar Entry

This guide is for bars who sell skip-the-line passes through LineHop. Please have your employees/bouncers read over this guide to ensure optimal results.

1. Ask to see the person's Skip-the-line pass. (Available at Me > Redeem Passes and have the user select the pass for your bar)
2. Ensure that the person's profile picture is moving side-to-side before tapping "redeem me"
3. Confirm the redemption by tapping Redeem in the alert.

Please read the "Rejection" guide to be prepared for any problems that may arise.
