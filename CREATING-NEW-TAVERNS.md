# Creating New Taverns

Superusers are the only kind of user that have high enough priviledges to create new taverns on the platform. Taverns can exist independent from a bar administrator, but some features will be unavailable.

## What is a Tavern?
Taverns are LineHop entities that are displayed to local users who are signed into the iOS application. A LineHop entity includes the following bits of information:

- Name
- City
- Location Coordinates
- Profile Picture
- Skip-the-line Pass details (availability and price)

## Who manages Tavern entities?
Superusers may create and manage tavern entities or create a new bar administrator account for local bars to manage their own bar. Here are some limitations with superuser managed bars:

- Superuser managed taverns can not send out bar specific notifications.
- Superuser managed taverns should not enable Skip-the-Line passes (as local bars may not want this)

To create a new bar administrator account (for local bars), follow the "Creating New Users" guide. Bar administrators have the ability to:

- Send out bar specific notifications.
- Enable Skip-the-Line passes.

## How do I create a new Tavern?
