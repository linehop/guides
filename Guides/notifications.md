# Notifications
LineHop is equipped with the ability to send out both targeted and global notifications to standard users. The notification type you can send is chosen based on which kind of user you are. Bar administrators can send out targeted notifications to subscribed users. Superusers can send out global notifications. Read the [Creating New Users](https://github.com/linehop/guides/blob/master/Guides/creating-new-users.md) guide to learn more about the difference between user types. 

## What is a global notification?
Global notifications are sent out to all iOS LineHop users (with Push Notifications turned enabled).

## What is a targeted notification?
Targeted notifications are sent out to specific iOS LineHop users. Users who have previously subscribed to receive updates will receive the targeted notification. Push Notifications need to be enabled.
