## What does it mean to be "deactivated"?
Superusers have the ability to "deactivate" taverns on the LineHop platform. Deactivating a tavern temporarily removes visibility on the iOS application. Users will no longer be able to view, post to or purchase LineHop passes from this tavern until reactivated.
